                        Hello! I'm Andr√©, a recent graduate in Full Stack Web Development with <a href="https://codemaster.pt/" id="codemaster-link" target="_blank">codemaster</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my coursework, I immersed myself in both front-end and back-end development, gaining a comprehensive understanding of creating efficient and functional web applications. My passion for problem-solving and commitment to excellence drive me to be a dedicated and proactive professional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My eagerness to learn, coupled with a natural curiosity for problem-solving, are attributes that I believe are not only valuable professionally but also enhance my overall perspective on life. I am enthusiastic about applying my technical skills, constant commitment, and quick learning ability to contribute to challenging projects.
